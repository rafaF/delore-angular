# delore-angular v1.0.0
Just-add-water HTML template with Angular to start your web project with material design style in a few seconds

## Installation
Just donwload the zip and run the **index.html** in your favourite browser. If your are running your webapp in a server, move the delore-angular folder to the server's webroot folder

## Documentation
**delore-angular** includes the basic stuff to create a webapp with Material Design style and Angular.
- **Angular**: HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.
- **jQuery**: jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
- **MaterilizeCSS**: CSS Framework based on material design
- **ResetCSS**: The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on
- **Reset-this**: The CSS3 keyword initial sets the CSS3 property to the initial value as defined in the spec. The initial keyword has broad browser support except for the IE and Opera Mini families.
Since IE's lack of support may cause issue with resetThis you have some of the ways you can reset some CSS properties to their initial values
